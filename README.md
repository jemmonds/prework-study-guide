Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This project was my first exposure to using HTML,CSS, JavaScript as well using github. I built this to gain an understanding of how these technologies work and to get an insight into the upcoming frontend development course. It allows me to have an overview of what I completed in the course and let others see my work. I learnt to be patient and to read files carefully.
